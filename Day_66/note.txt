This lesson's goal is to build a REST API from scratch using Flask

Rest is actually an acronymn

It stands for:
REpresentational
State
Transfer

(I also remember there are other API types. I think SOAP is one of them.)

The request is sent as an HTTP request.
They can also be FTP requests.

HTTPS (simply a "secure" version of HTTP)

REST is just an an architectual style

REST came about from Roy Fielding's PHD thesis around year 2000

This basically put in place a bunch of rules for making an API restful

The 2 main rules:
1. Use HTTP request Verbs (GET, POST, Put/Patch(patch is new as of 2010), DELETE)
-- CRUD for databases (Create, Read, Update, Delete) it almost mimics the HTTP Verbs

2. Use specific pattern of routes/endpoint urls
-- 


Put is the equivelent of a full replacement.
Patch is essentially just fix the part that is wrong.
