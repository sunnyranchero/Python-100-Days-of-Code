Goal:
Building a RESTful Blog with Editing!

###########################

GET request upon loading of home
endpoint is /post/4

so this will need a <int:id> in the routing

###########################

POST request upon adding a new article
endpoint is /new-post/
redirects back to home after submtting the post.

###########################

PUT for editing the content of an existing post
(I think this means we will be replacing the existing content in full rather
than PATCHING a portion like we did in Day 66)

endpoint is /edit-post/4
so this will need a <int:id> in the routing

the form is prepopulated with the values from before.
it redirects back to the post after the edit.
